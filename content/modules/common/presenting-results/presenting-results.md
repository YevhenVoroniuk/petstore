When presenting the results of the practical tasks, please follow these guidelines:



1. If you have **multiple screenshots**, please compile them into a single **PDF or DOCX** file. You are encouraged to include comments on the screenshots to provide context and explanations.
2. If you have recorded a **demo**, please present it as a **GIF** file. This format will help showcase the dynamic aspects of your work effectively.
3. Avoid attempting to pack screenshots into a GIF file. Such an approach may result in your assignment being returned for revision.

Please use the following sample file name format: **Lastname - Module X.pdf** (e.g.: Slufarski - Module 5.pdf). This will help in organizing and identifying your submissions easily.

Make sure to review the provided samples to get a clear idea of the expected presentation format.

Additionally, please ensure that the total size of all your files does not exceed **25 MB**.

Following these guidelines will help us evaluate your practical task results effectively. If you have any questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to ask. Good luck with your submissions!
